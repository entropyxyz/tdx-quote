Parses TDX quotes (v4 and v5)

Currently WIP

This is based on [tdx-quote-parser](https://github.com/MoeMahhouk/tdx-quote-parser) for the types and [sgx-quote](https://docs.rs/sgx-quote) for the no-std parsing using [nom](https://docs.rs/nom).

Full spec in [Intel TDX DCAP Quoting Library API](https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/latest/dcap-latest/linux/docs/Intel_TDX_DCAP_Quoting_Library_API.pdf), appendix 3.
